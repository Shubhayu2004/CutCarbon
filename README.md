# CutCarbon
This is CutCarbon's Repository for The GDSC Solution challenge India

How a User is going to use our application: 

 

1)The user will take a picture of the prototype or the machine. If the machine produces sound, then the User will take the readings of the sound produced by the sound in general use.  

 

2)The Image will recognize the Main Object using the data fed to the website 

 

3)based on the relevance of the feed that we have given to the (name of the website), it will estimate the value of carbon footprints, and thus give an estimate of whether it's good for the environment or not. This estimation will give the User an idea of the loss(both economically and environmentally) using the statistics. This will be the prediction of the loss(if any), so further inspection will be decided. 

 

4) Based on the surroundings, the model predicts the outcomes of the sound the machine produces. (if any). 

 

 

Process of How Our Model Works: 

 

The user takes the Image of the area which Includes The Main Object, and also the sound readings of the machine. To avoid discrepancies in the output the User has to give information about the ratings previously given to the device(if any) 

 

Image-Recognition. The (Name) identifies and classifies the activities within the range and it prioritizes the Main Object. 

 

Preprocessing of the Image and the sound readings. (Cropping or Resizing the Image(Manual or automated) and removing the Noise which causes differences in the outputs of the values(Automated)) 

 

 

Model Inference: (The model is trained by exposing it to a labeled dataset. It learns to recognize patterns and relationships within the data. Then the model is considered trained. This Model could be used for inference, where the Model can now predict the outcomes)(The prediction is done using carbon footprint estimation) 

 

Output Displaying to the User. (The predictions that are made are shown to the User, of the user has given the input of the initial or previous rating it will also be considered for lower discrepancy, The predictions are positive if both sound and environmental impact are bearable, and if any of one case fails then, further inspection is required) 

 

Statistical Analysis: The application investigates the location of the image taken and the surroundings according to the picture and gives an idea of the effect of the surroundings by using such a machine. This includes a rough estimation economically and environmentally.  

 

User Feedback: 

The application/website allows the users to interact with the Users, providing feedback and additional information required. This includes further training in the application/website. This results in the continuous improvement of the application/website. This feedback includes the user giving the initial ratings of the machine to understand the difference between the model and the rated data. 

Sustainable development goals we will be working on: 

 

1. Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being: 

   - Our project addresses environmental pollution, which has direct and indirect effects on human health and well-being. 

 

2. Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities: 

   - By monitoring and predicting pollution levels, Our application contributes to creating more sustainable and environmentally friendly communities. 

 

3. Goal 13: Climate Action: 

   - Your focus on carbon footprint and pollution aligns with efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainable practices. 

 

4. Goal 14: Life Below Water and Goal 15: Life on Land: 

   - Pollution has significant impacts on ecosystems, both aquatic and terrestrial. Your project contributes to monitoring and mitigating these impacts
